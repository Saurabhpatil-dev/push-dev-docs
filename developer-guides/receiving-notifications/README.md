# Receiving Notifications

{% hint style="success" %}
Integrating receiving notifications is a critical component as it enables your users to have the best experience and improve massively on web3 UX. \
\
However, it is not required as Push is an open network and already have integrations. If you want to just test out sent notifications then head to [testing-sent-notifications.md](../testing-sent-notifications.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
This section is relevant for dApps / Wallets / Extensions / Web 2.5 Bots (Like Discord, Telegram, Twitter, etc) that want to integrate receiving notifications on their platform.
{% endhint %}

As a developer, you might want to integrate these notifications into your own platforms such as your dApp, Mobile App, Wallet Extension or Web 2.5 platforms like creating a Telegram, Twitter, Email, Discord bots, etc.
